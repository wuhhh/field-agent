## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation & Setup

The plugin is already installed as a local Composer package. Set up AI integration:

**Add API keys to `.ddev/config.yaml`** (Recommended):
```yaml
webimage_extra_environment:
  - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
  - OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```
Then run: `ddev restart`

**Verify setup:**
```bash
ddev craft field-agent/generator/test-llm
```

### 2. Context-Aware Field Generation

The system automatically determines whether to create new structures or modify existing ones:

```bash
# Create new structures from scratch
ddev craft field-agent/generator/prompt "Create a portfolio section with project fields"

# Intelligently modify existing structures
ddev craft field-agent/generator/prompt "Add author and featured image to blog posts"

# Smart field reuse across sections
ddev craft field-agent/generator/prompt "Create news section with title, content, and featured image"

# ContentBlock fields (Craft 5.8+ feature)
ddev craft field-agent/generator/prompt "Create a content block field for hero sections with title, description, and background image"

# Apply changes to Craft
ddev craft up
```

## 📋 Core Commands

### 🎯 Context-Aware Generation (Primary Interface)

```bash
# One intelligent command handles everything
ddev craft field-agent/generator/prompt "<description>" [provider] [--debug]

# Examples:
ddev craft field-agent/generator/prompt "Add testimonials to the landing page"
ddev craft field-agent/generator/prompt "Create a team section with member profiles"
ddev craft field-agent/generator/prompt "Modify blog posts to include tags and categories"
```

**The system automatically:**
- Analyzes existing project structure
- Determines appropriate operations (create/modify)
- Reuses existing fields when beneficial
- Prevents handle conflicts
- Executes operations in proper dependency order

### 🔍 Project Discovery & Analysis

```bash
# Analyze current project state
ddev craft field-agent/generator/test-discovery

# Get detailed field information
ddev craft field-agent/generator/discovery/fields

# Analyze sections and entry types
ddev craft field-agent/generator/discovery/sections

# Check handle availability
ddev craft field-agent/generator/discovery/check-handle <handle>
```

### 📊 Operation Management

```bash
# List all operations with detailed history
ddev craft field-agent/generator/operations

# Rollback specific operation
ddev craft field-agent/generator/rollback <operation-id>

# Rollback ALL operations (with confirmation)
ddev craft field-agent/generator/rollback-all

# Clean up old operations and configs
ddev craft field-agent/generator/prune-all --confirm=1
```

### 🤖 AI Provider Options

```bash

# Export API templates for manual testing
ddev craft field-agent/generator/export-prompt
```

## 🎨 Example Workflows

### ✨ Intelligent Modification
Starting with an existing blog section:
```bash
ddev craft field-agent/generator/prompt "Add author and featured image to blog posts"
```
**System intelligently:**
1. Creates `author` and `featuredImage` fields
2. Adds them to existing `blogPost` entry type
3. Preserves all existing fields and settings

### 🎯 Smart Field Reuse
With existing `featuredImage` field:
```bash
ddev craft field-agent/generator/prompt "Create news section with title, content, and featured image"
```
**System intelligently:**
1. Creates `newsTitle` and `newsContent` fields (avoiding reserved names)
2. Reuses existing `featuredImage` field
3. Creates news section and entry type with proper relationships

### 🛡️ Automatic Conflict Prevention
```bash
ddev craft field-agent/generator/prompt "Create fields for title, content, and author"
```
**System automatically uses safe alternatives:**
- `title` → `pageTitle`, `blogTitle`, `articleTitle`
- `content` → `bodyContent`, `mainContent`, `description`
- `author` → `writer`, `creator`, `byline`
