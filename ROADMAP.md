## Phase 2: Relational Fields (Controlled Dependencies) - âœ… COMPLETE
**Target**: Fields that relate to entities we control or that are safe to assume

### âœ… Completed
**Structured:**
- âœ… `matrix` - Matrix field (can reference our own created entry types)
  - âœ… **Dependency**: Requires entry types to be created first
  - âœ… **Solution**: Create in proper order (sections â†’ entry types â†’ fields â†’ matrix)
  - âœ… **Implementation**: Full matrix support with block types as entry types
  - âœ… **AI Integration**: Natural language prompts generate complete matrix configurations

**Relational (Safe Dependencies):**
- âœ… `users` - User relations (uses existing user system, safe assumption)

## Decision Log

### 2025-01-26: Phase 1 Scope Decision
**Decision**: Implement Phase 1 (13 safe field types) first
**Rationale**: 
- Low risk, high value
- No dependency management needed
- Builds user confidence
- Establishes patterns for future phases

**Deferred**: Categories, tags, and complex table fields
**Reason**: Require entity creation capabilities not yet built

### 2025-06-26: Matrix Field Implementation Complete
**Decision**: Complete matrix field support ahead of other Phase 2 items
**Rationale**:
- High user value for page builders and flexible layouts
- Demonstrates complex field creation capabilities
- Validates creation order enforcement system
- Proves AI can handle complex nested structures

**Implementation Details**:
- Matrix fields create entry types as "block types"
- Unique field handle generation prevents conflicts
- Full AI/LLM integration with natural language prompts
- Schema validation for nested block type structures

**Results**: 21 field types now supported, matrix fields working end-to-end

### 2025-06-26: Phase 2 Complete - Relational Fields Implementation
**Decision**: Complete implementation of users and entries field types
**Rationale**:
- High user value for content relationships and workflow management
- Leverages existing Craft user system (safe dependency)
- Enables self-referential entry relationships within generated sections
- Completes the controlled dependency field types for Phase 2

**Implementation Details**:
- Users field supports user group sources and wildcard (*) for all users
- Entries field supports section sources for self-created sections
- Removed non-existent allowMultiple property (Craft handles this via maxRelations)
- Full AI/LLM integration with natural language prompts
- Schema validation updated for new field types

**Results**: 25 field types now supported, all relational fields and complex structures working end-to-end

### 2025-01-29: Context-Aware Modification System Complete âœ¨
**Decision**: Implemented full context-aware operations system instead of Phase 3 fields
**Rationale**:

- Enables incremental development workflows
- Prevents "blank slate only" limitation

**Implementation Details**:
- Discovery Service provides real-time project analysis
- Operations-based architecture (create/modify/delete)
- Single intelligent `/prompt` endpoint handles all operations
- Smart field reuse across entry types
- Reserved field handle protection with automatic alternatives
- Complete rollback system with audit trail

**Results**: 
- System now intelligently modifies existing structures
- Can add fields to existing entry types
- Automatically reuses appropriate fields
- Prevents conflicts and handle collisions
- Major improvement in user experience

### 2025-07-20: ContentBlock Field Support Added âœ¨ 
**Decision**: Added support for Craft 5.8's new ContentBlock field type
**Rationale**:
- New field type introduced in Craft CMS 5.8.0
- User explicitly requested ContentBlock support
- Provides reusable content structures with nested field layouts
- Leverages existing field layout infrastructure from Matrix fields

**Implementation Details**:
- ContentBlock field creation in both FieldCreationService and FieldGeneratorService
- Full field layout support with nested field creation and management
- Three view modes: grouped, pane, and inline
- AI/LLM integration with natural language prompts
- Schema validation updated to include content_block field type
- Comprehensive test coverage with nested field scenarios

**Results**: 25 field types fully supported, ContentBlock fields working end-to-end

### 2025-07-20: Phase 3-4 Complete - Advanced Entity Management âœ¨
**Decision**: Completed category groups, tag groups, and table field support
**Rationale**:
- User requested update reflecting current capabilities
- All complex dependency field types now fully supported
- System can create and manage complete taxonomies
- Table fields provide structured data capabilities

**Implementation Details**:
- Category group creation with field layouts and hierarchical structure
- Tag group creation with field layouts and flexible tagging
- Table field support with column definitions and data types
- Complete dependency resolution for all entity types
- Smart creation order management for complex operations

**Results**: All 25 field types supported, complete CMS ecosystem management

### Next Review: Advanced Features vs. Performance Optimization
**Evaluate**: Template generation, advanced AI features vs. performance optimization
**Consider**: Batch operations, custom prompting, multi-site support
**Assess**: User feedback on most valuable next enhancements beyond field creation
