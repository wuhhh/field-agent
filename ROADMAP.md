**Total: +13 field types + 1 enhancement** ‚Üí **20 total supported**

### Implementation Notes
- All these fields are self-contained or use existing Craft infrastructure
- No external entity creation required
- Settings are straightforward and well-documented
- Low complexity, high value additions

## Phase 2: Relational Fields (Controlled Dependencies) - ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Target**: Fields that relate to entities we control or that are safe to assume

### ‚úÖ Completed
**Structured:**
- ‚úÖ `matrix` - Matrix field (can reference our own created entry types)
  - ‚úÖ **Dependency**: Requires entry types to be created first
  - ‚úÖ **Solution**: Create in proper order (sections ‚Üí entry types ‚Üí fields ‚Üí matrix)
  - ‚úÖ **Implementation**: Full matrix support with block types as entry types
  - ‚úÖ **AI Integration**: Natural language prompts generate complete matrix configurations

**Relational (Safe Dependencies):**
- ‚úÖ `users` - User relations (uses existing user system, safe assumption)
  - ‚úÖ **Implementation**: Full user field support with source configuration
  - ‚úÖ **AI Integration**: Natural language prompts generate user field configurations
  - ‚úÖ **Source Support**: User groups and wildcard (*) support
- ‚úÖ `entries` - Entry relations (can reference our own created entry types)
  - ‚úÖ **Implementation**: Full entries field support with section source configuration
  - ‚úÖ **AI Integration**: Natural language prompts generate entry relationship configurations
  - ‚úÖ **Self-Reference**: Can reference sections created in same operation

### Implementation Strategy
1. ‚úÖ **Creation Order Enforcement**: Ensure proper dependency order
2. ‚úÖ **Self-Reference Only**: Initially only allow references to entities we create
3. ‚úÖ **Validation Layer**: Prevent references to external entities not yet supported

**Total: +3 completed** ‚Üí **23 total supported**

## Phase 3: Complex Dependencies (Future)
**Target**: Fields requiring external entity creation capabilities

### ‚ùå Not Yet Supported (High Complexity)
**Relational (Complex Dependencies):**
- `categories` - Category relations
  - **Blocker**: Requires category group creation
  - **Future**: Need category group creation system
- `tags` - Tag relations  
  - **Blocker**: Requires tag group creation
  - **Future**: Need tag group creation system

### üîÑ Advanced Structured
**Complex:**
- `table` - Table field for structured data
  - **Consideration**: Complex column definitions
  - **Future**: Needs careful schema design for table structure

**Total blocked: 3 field types**

## Phase 4: Advanced Entity Management (Long-term)
**Target**: Full ecosystem creation capabilities

### Future Capabilities Needed
1. **Category System Creation**:
   - Create category groups
   - Create categories within groups
   - Associate category fields with specific groups

2. **Tag System Creation**:
   - Create tag groups  
   - Create initial tags (optional)
   - Associate tag fields with specific groups

3. **Advanced Table Support**:
   - Define complex column structures
   - Support multiple data types within tables
   - Handle table relationship configurations

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Entity Creation Services**: Build services for creating categories/tags
2. **Dependency Resolution**: Smart dependency ordering system
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle existing vs. new entity conflicts
4. **Advanced Prompting**: LLM guidance for complex entity structures

## Implementation Priorities

### Immediate (Phase 1): Simple Extensions
**Effort**: Low | **Value**: High | **Risk**: Low
- 13 new field types with no dependencies
- Straightforward implementation
- Immediate user value
- No breaking changes

### Near-term (Phase 2): Controlled Relations  
**Effort**: Medium | **Value**: High | **Risk**: Medium
- 3 new field types with controlled dependencies
- Requires creation order management
- High user value for content relationships
- Manageable complexity

### Long-term (Phase 3-4): Full Ecosystem
**Effort**: High | **Value**: Medium | **Risk**: High  
- Complex entity management
- Requires significant architecture changes
- High maintenance overhead
- Consider for v2.0 of plugin

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (Phase 1)
- **Self-contained fields**: No external dependencies
- **Proven patterns**: Similar to existing implementations
- **Easy rollback**: Isolated changes

### Medium Risk (Phase 2)  
- **Dependency management**: Creation order critical
- **Reference validation**: Must prevent broken references
- **Testing complexity**: More integration scenarios

### High Risk (Phase 3-4)
- **Architecture changes**: Significant system modifications
- **Conflict resolution**: Complex edge cases
- **Maintenance burden**: Ongoing complexity

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Targets - ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- [x] Field creation succeeds in Craft CMS for all types
- [x] Both Anthropic and OpenAI support all new types
- [x] Documentation covers all field types with examples
- [x] Performance impact < 10% increase

### Phase 2 Targets - ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
- [x] Entry relations work with self-created entry types
- [x] User relations integrate with existing user system
- [x] Matrix fields support basic configurations
- [x] Creation order is enforced and reliable
- [x] Validation prevents invalid references

## Decision Log

### 2025-01-26: Phase 1 Scope Decision
**Decision**: Implement Phase 1 (13 safe field types) first
**Rationale**: 
- Low risk, high value
- No dependency management needed
- Builds user confidence
- Establishes patterns for future phases

**Deferred**: Categories, tags, and complex table fields
**Reason**: Require entity creation capabilities not yet built

### 2025-06-26: Matrix Field Implementation Complete
**Decision**: Complete matrix field support ahead of other Phase 2 items
**Rationale**:
- High user value for page builders and flexible layouts
- Demonstrates complex field creation capabilities
- Validates creation order enforcement system
- Proves AI can handle complex nested structures

**Implementation Details**:
- Matrix fields create entry types as "block types"
- Unique field handle generation prevents conflicts
- Full AI/LLM integration with natural language prompts
- Schema validation for nested block type structures

**Results**: 21 field types now supported, matrix fields working end-to-end

### 2025-06-26: Phase 2 Complete - Relational Fields Implementation
**Decision**: Complete implementation of users and entries field types
**Rationale**:
- High user value for content relationships and workflow management
- Leverages existing Craft user system (safe dependency)
- Enables self-referential entry relationships within generated sections
- Completes the controlled dependency field types for Phase 2

**Implementation Details**:
- Users field supports user group sources and wildcard (*) for all users
- Entries field supports section sources for self-created sections
- Removed non-existent allowMultiple property (Craft handles this via maxRelations)
- Full AI/LLM integration with natural language prompts
- Schema validation updated for new field types

**Results**: 23 field types now supported, all Phase 2 relational fields working end-to-end

### 2025-01-29: Context-Aware Modification System Complete ‚ú®
**Decision**: Implemented full context-aware operations system instead of Phase 3 fields
**Rationale**:
- User explicitly requested ability to modify existing structures
- Higher value than adding more field types
- Enables incremental development workflows
- Prevents "blank slate only" limitation

**Implementation Details**:
- Discovery Service provides real-time project analysis
- Operations-based architecture (create/modify/delete)
- Single intelligent `/prompt` endpoint handles all operations
- Smart field reuse across entry types
- Reserved field handle protection with automatic alternatives
- Complete rollback system with audit trail

**Results**: 
- System now intelligently modifies existing structures
- Can add fields to existing entry types
- Automatically reuses appropriate fields
- Prevents conflicts and handle collisions
- Major improvement in user experience

### Next Review: Phase 3 Fields vs. Enhancement Priorities
**Evaluate**: Complex dependency fields (categories, tags) vs. other enhancements
**Consider**: Template generation, performance optimization, batch operations
**Assess**: User feedback on most valuable next features
