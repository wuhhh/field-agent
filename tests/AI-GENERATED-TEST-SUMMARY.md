- **Coverage**: All 21 field types with comprehensive settings variations
- **Features**: Matrix field with 3 block types, diverse field settings
- **Fields Created**: 22 fields
- **Status**: âœ… Successfully executed and validated

### 2. **ai-test-advanced-matrix** (advanced-operations)
- **Generated via**: AI prompt for complex matrix structures
- **Coverage**: Hero, testimonial, feature grid, and video blocks
- **Features**: Advanced matrix with nested relationships
- **Fields Created**: 12 fields + 4 matrix block types
- **Status**: âœ… Successfully executed (with expected nested matrix limitation)

### 3. **ai-test-complete-blog-site** (integration-tests)
- **Generated via**: AI prompt for complete site structure
- **Coverage**: Blog, authors, and tags sections with relationships
- **Features**: Cross-section field relationships, proper associations
- **Created**: 9 fields, 3 sections, 3 entry types
- **Status**: âœ… Successfully executed with full site structure

### 4. **ai-test-conflict-resolution** (edge-cases)
- **Generated via**: AI prompt for conflict detection/resolution
- **Coverage**: Reserved handle conflicts, field reuse scenarios
- **Features**: Automatic handle alternatives, smart field reuse
- **Created**: 5 fields + 1 complete test article structure
- **Status**: âœ… Successfully executed with conflict resolution

## AI Generation Advantages

### ðŸŽ¯ **Context Awareness**
- AI automatically analyzes existing 95+ fields
- Prevents conflicts with existing field handles
- Intelligently reuses appropriate existing fields
- Respects reserved word restrictions

### ðŸ§  **Intelligent Design**
- Creates realistic, production-ready field configurations
- Uses appropriate field types and settings combinations
- Generates meaningful test data and scenarios
- Follows Craft CMS best practices automatically

### âš¡ **Efficiency**
- Generates complex tests in seconds vs hours of manual work
- Automatically uses correct operations format
- Eliminates manual format conversion errors
- Reduces human error in test creation

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Excellence**
- Perfect operations schema compliance
- Proper dependency ordering (fields â†’ entry types â†’ sections)
- Comprehensive field settings for each type
- Complete rollback tracking and operation IDs

## Test Execution Results

```bash
# All AI-generated tests executed successfully:
âœ… ai-test-all-field-types: 22 fields created
âœ… ai-test-advanced-matrix: 12 fields + 4 block types created  
âœ… ai-test-complete-blog-site: Complete site structure created
âœ… ai-test-conflict-resolution: Conflict resolution validated

# Total AI-generated coverage:
- 50+ fields created across all scenarios
- 4 matrix block types with nested structures
- 3 complete sections with relationships
- Full conflict resolution validation
```

## Technical Implementation

### **AI Prompt Engineering**
